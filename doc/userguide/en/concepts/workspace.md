## Workspace ##

Workspace is the core concept in Docklet. It represents a WEB based
interactive working environment. The Docklet Workspace is provided by an
open source component [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), by which
users can create and share documents that contain live code, equations,
visualizations and explanatory text. It can be used in the following
area: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation,
statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.

For most users, they do not care about the low level details of physical
hosts, clusters, containers or vclusters. They only need to open a
browser to enter their personal Workspace, then interactively do
their jobs, even including visualizations in the browser. Currently the
Jupyter Notebook supports more than 40 programming languages.

For advanced users, Jupyter Notebook offers WEB Terminal to accomplish
all most all non-visualization works.
