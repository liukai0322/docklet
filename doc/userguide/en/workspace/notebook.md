## Interactive Programming ##

Jupyter Notebook has a very attractive feature of **interactive
programming** in browser. It provides a web-based application suitable
for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting,
and executing code, as well as communicating the results. 

Main features including but not limited to: 
* The ability to execute code from the browser, with the results of
computations attached to the code which generated them.
* Displaying the result of computation using rich media representations,
such as HTML, LaTeX, PNG, SVG, etc. For example, publication-quality
figures rendered by the matplotlib library, can be included inline.
* In-browser editing for rich text using the Markdown markup language,
which can provide commentary for the code, is not limited to plain text.
* The ability to easily include mathematical notation within markdown
cells using LaTeX, and rendered natively by MathJax.

Please refer to [The Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/notebook.html) for more info.

The [Development Demo](../notebook/README.md) section gives some help about programming in 
Notebook, mainly programming using Python and R packages.
