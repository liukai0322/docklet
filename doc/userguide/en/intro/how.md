## How to use Docklet ##

For Docklet users to access their Workspace, what they need is only a
modern web browser, such as Firefox, Chrome or Safari.


Docklet administrator will configure the authentication method. 
For example, the instance deployed at the Computing Center in Peking 
University, http://iwork.internetware.org , supports authenticating both 
Peking University accounts and Docklet internal accounts.

Docklet also supports Guest account. Users can try the "Workspace" using
the guest account with some limitations. The Guest Workspace will
restart periodically.
