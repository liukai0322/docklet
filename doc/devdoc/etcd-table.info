# ETCD Table

we use etcd for some configuration information of our clusters, here is some details.

every cluster has a CLUSTER_NAME and all data of this cluster is put in a directory called CLUSTER_NAME in etcd just like a table.

so, different cluster should has different CLUSTER_NAME.

below is content of cluster info in CLUSTER_NAME 'table' in etcd:
<type>		<name>		<content>		<description>   
key    token             random code  token for checking whether master and workers has the same global filesystem

dir    machines            ...        info of physical clusters
dir    machines/allnodes  ip:ok       record all nodes, for recovery and checks  
dir    machines/runnodes  ip: ?       record running node for this start up.
                                      when startup:          ETCD
