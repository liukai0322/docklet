## Service ##

Many sofware tools in Docklet image can be run directly as script in the
terminal. But there are also some software frameworks need to run as
service, e.g., [Spark](http://spark.apache.org). When users create a
Workspace, those frameworks are not started in default, to reduce
resource consumption.  Users may configure their Docklet vcluser, to
allow starting specified software frameworks.

Docklet can be configured to start user-installed software services.
