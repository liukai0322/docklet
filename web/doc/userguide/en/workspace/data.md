When users entering their Workspace of Jupyter Notebook, they will see
the tree of filesa and directories. Users can perform **Rename** and
**Delete** operating while selecting some files. 

Click **New** - **Folder** can create a folder. Click **New** - ** Text File
** can create a text file with name *untitled.txt*，and enter the [File Editing](edit.md) webpage.

Click **Upload**,  users can upload their data files to the Workspace.

**Note**:  The `~/nfs` directory is the [Dataspace](../concepts/nfs.md). The files in Dataspace will be shared among all containers in the vcluster, and are persistent. Files in other directory are all transient, will be destroyed when the container is deleted.
