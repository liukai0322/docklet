# Scientific Computation and Data Analysis #

Docklet supports scientific computation and data analysis mainly by two languages [Python](https://www.python.org) and [R](http://www.r-project.org), as well as plentiful packages.
Most work can be done in Jupyter Notebook, including data visualization,
with only a browser.

There are many articles in the WEB about how to use Pyton and R do big
data processing, scientific computing, machine learning and deep
learning, natural language processing, statistics, data mining, graph
processing, data visualization, etc. In these articles, what is valuable
to novice users is what packages can be used in what kind of tasks.

[ANACONDA](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda) from 
[CONTINUUM](https://www.continuum.io) is a computation and analysis
platform. It integrates both useful open source Python packages and R packages.

The [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) from 
[ENTHOUGHT](https://www.enthought.com) is a platform similar to CONTINUUM.
It also integrates many useful Python packages for computation and
analysis.

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) introduces [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio2/) and several 
[useful R packages](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/).

Though many visualization and IDE packages need to run in local
OS, most packages in Docklet can run in Jupyter Notebook as Web app.
Users can use `pip` or other tools to install those packages needed.

The list of Python and  R packages in Docklet:

 * [Python Packages](python.md)
 * [R Packages](r.md)
